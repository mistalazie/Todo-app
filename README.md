#### Questions and Answers

**Why does the size of the box increase or decrease when we wrap a div around a section?**

Adjusting the margin to auto, this way the div automatically adjusts the margin and centers the div

**CSS Selector for class, id and tag?**

**What are event handlers, event listeners and event delegation?**

_Event Handlers_ directly assigns a behavior to a HTML element eg: onClick, onChange, etc.

_Event listener_ is a function that listens for a specific type of event on a specified element. In contrast to event handlers, event listeners are attached using JavaScript methods like addEventListener.

_Event delegation_ is when a single event listener is add to a parent element which can even listen to dynamically added element to the HTML. It allows us to remove multiple event listener to our HTML elements.
